It\u2019s probably just my imagination. Also things are looking good, and the experiment seems to be successful. I just need time to examine the results and confirm my hypothesis."}, "note 3": {"title": "Failure", "day": 13, "text": "It\u2019s been a sad three days. Experiment 4 that I thought proved to be a success ended up slowly decaying, and now I have to find somewhere to dispose of it\u2019s carcass. Maybe all of this is not worth it.

Sometimes at night, I hallucinate and see her standing outside my window and just watching me. But I know that\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s already been five years since the accident. I just miss her touch so much. She always understood me and my work. Unlike those filthy pigs at the academy."}, "note 6": {"title": "Experiment 13", "day": 57, "text": "I somehow lost Experiment 13. I\u2019m sure last night I strapped it back in, double checking that it was restrained. However, when I went to check today, it wasn\u2019t there anymore. Very strange. What\u2019s even more confusing is it seems that the chains were cleanly cut, but that\u2019s not possible."}, "note 7": {"title": "Breakthrough!", "day": 92, "text": "I\u2019ve made a breakthrough!

And once again when I went to check who it was, there wasn\u2019t anybody there. I looked around and checked around the mansion, but still found nothing. I think I\u2019ve been spending too much time in the lab. Doctor did say to get Vitamin D \u2026 or was it C? Which one gave you scurvy?

She was so vivid and realistic, and she came so close to me I could almost count each individual mole on her neck that formed a star. Her silky smooth blonde hair seems just as soft as I remember.

It\u2019s two nights in a row, and this time there were two of her. I was so ecstatic I tried running up to both of her, in the dream of course, and I ended up hitting my toe on the nightstand. What confuses me is that I woke up today with a big welt on the same toe I stubbed in my dream. My sleepwalking must be getting worse."}, "note 13": {"title": "Medication", "day": 125, "text": "The doctor prescribed me some medication for my toe. For some reason, every night since that dream, when I wake up in the morning the welt seems to get bigger and hurt even more. So I went to the doctor and he gave me some percocets. That dream made me miss Molly even more. If only I could have an infinite number of Mollys to be with me and understand me. What was I talking about? Oh yeah, percocets. But Molly... percocets."}, "note 14": {"title": "Someone is watching\u2026", "day": 141, "text": "In recent days, I have made more and more breakthroughs, but I feel that someone has been watching me. Whenever I\u2019m in the lab and working on an experiment, I get a feeling that someone is looking over my shoulder. I\u2019m worried it\u2019s those dirty pigs from the academy. They must be after my research especially now that I\u2019m so close to succeeding. But I\u2019ll never let them get a hold of this.
